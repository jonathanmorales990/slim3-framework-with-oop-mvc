# Simple skelleton of a Slim3 aplication with PDO and MVC

You can find the Models, Views and controllers inside the app paste, i left the htaccess if you wanna use lamp or xampp without the command line
to start the slim framework.

just use **composer install** (if not loading class user **composer dump-autoload -o**)to install the dependencies.
